In this game, the `red target` is routinely moving from the left to the right of the screen. The player can adjust the "gun"'s (_green_) location and shoot bullets to hit the moving target. Each time the bullet hits the target, the player get 3 points. The player will win by getting more than 15 points in 40 seconds. Once the player wins, music will be played to celebrate the player's victory.
